This dataset includes georeferenced plot-level forest carbon estimates for Nepal as a supplement to a data paper submitted to the Scientific Data journal. The dataset is based on field observations from Nepal's national forest inventory from 2010 to 2014 and includes estimates for two major forest carbon pools: aboveground biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks from 2,009 and 1,156 inventory plots, respectively. The forest AGB includes all trees within each sample plot, including standing dead and stumps, while the forest SOC stock includes the organic carbon in the 0-30 cm depth. The organic litter was excluded from the plot-level estimates of SOC due to missing records for many plots. Other analyses have reported a very low contribution of litter to the total carbon stocks in Nepal's forests (<1%).

The dataset is presented as a comma-separated table with five columns. The ‘plot_id’ column contains a unique plot number for each forest inventory plot. The ‘long’ and ‘lat’’ columns represent longitude and latitude in the EPSG:4326 spatial reference system. The columns ‘AGB_tha’ and ‘SOC_tha’ represent plot-level forest AGB and SOC, in t ha-1, respectively. Missing values are indicated with ‘NA’.

## Important Note on Raw Data

The authors note that while the estimates are public, the raw input data (individual tree-level measurements and specific soil attributes) is managed by the government of Nepal. If you require the raw tree-level data, you must submit a formal inquiry to the Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC) under the Ministry of Forests and Environment, Nepal.
